This is what worked for me as I was undergoing a Udemy course: 1. Install HomeBrew by typing this into your terminal

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
Move your old /data/db folder (if you want to backup your current dbs) into a non root folder and proceed with the next step

Run in Terminal 
a) brew uninstall mongodb 
b) If needed run brew uninstall --force mongodb 
c) brew tap mongodb/brew 
d) brew install mongodb-community 
e) brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community

All you need now is to run mongo 
in the Terminal and you'll see the mongo shell symbol >.
